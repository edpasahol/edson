        <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>

        <p>
            In this lesson, I learned that CSS can be used to manage the 
            <span class="highlight">dimensions</span> of web elements such as 
            width, height, and visibility. These properties allow us to 
            control the layout and appearance of different parts of a webpage, 
            making them more flexible and organized.
        </p>

        <p>
            The important properties I learned include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>visibility</strong> – determines whether an element is visible or hidden.</li>
            <li><strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong> – control the size of an element.</li>
            <li><strong>max-width / min-width</strong> – define the maximum and minimum width.</li>
            <li><strong>max-height / min-height</strong> – define the maximum and minimum height.</li>
            <li><strong>line-height</strong> – adjusts the spacing between lines of text.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I also learned about <span class="highlight">CSS Pseudo-Classes</span>, 
            which are special selectors that define the behavior of elements 
            under certain conditions. These are commonly used with links 
            to control how they look when interacted with.
        </p>

        <p>
            The four main link pseudo-classes are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>:link</strong> – for unvisited links.</li>
            <li><strong>:visited</strong> – for links that have been clicked before.</li>
            <li><strong>:hover</strong> – when the mouse pointer is over a link.</li>
            <li><strong>:active</strong> – when the link is being clicked.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I discovered that the correct order to write these is 
            <span class="highlight">LVHA (Link, Visited, Hover, Active)</span> 
            to make sure all link effects display properly. 
            I also learned that pseudo-classes are not only for links — they can 
            be used for images, paragraphs, and other elements to make websites 
            more interactive and dynamic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this lesson helped me understand how to control both the 
            <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>behavior</strong> of webpage 
            elements using CSS. By mastering dimensions and pseudo-classes, 
            I can make web pages that are both well-designed and user-friendly.
