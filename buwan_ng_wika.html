        <h2>Reflection Questions and Answers</h2>

        <p><strong>1. What is the most important thing I learned from the event?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The most important thing I learned from the Buwan ng Wika celebration 
            is the value of <span class="highlight">preserving and promoting our Filipino language and culture</span>. 
            The event reminded me that our language is more than just a way to communicate — 
            it is a reflection of our identity, history, and unity as a nation.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. How can I apply what I learned in real-life situations?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I can apply what I learned by speaking Filipino more confidently in daily conversations 
            and by using it in writing, social media, and school activities. 
            I will also promote our local dialects and encourage others to take pride in our heritage.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Did I actively participate in the event? How?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Yes, I actively participated by joining classroom activities related to Buwan ng Wika, 
            such our declamation performance task in Filipino and wearing traditional Filipino attire every monday of the month. 
            
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. If I were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I would explain that Buwan ng Wika is a celebration that honors the importance 
            of our national language — Filipino — and reminds us to cherish our cultural roots. 
            It encourages everyone to use our language with pride and respect, 
            especially in schools and communities.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer.</strong></p>
        <p>
            It is important to have events like Buwan ng Wika because they allow us 
            to connect what we learn in school to real-life experiences. 
            These events make learning more meaningful and enjoyable while promoting 
            creativity, participation, and appreciation for our culture and identity.
        </p>

                During the Buwan ng Wika celebration, students showcased their talents 
                through performances and cultural presentations. 
                Everyone wore traditional Filipino clothing such as barong and filipiniana,
