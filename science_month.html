        <h2>Reflection Questions and Answers</h2>

        <p><strong>1. What is the most important thing I learned from the event?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The most important thing I learned from Science Month is how science influences 
            our daily lives and the importance of curiosity and discovery. 
            I realized that science is not only a school subject but also a tool that helps 
            us understand the world, solve problems, and improve our quality of life.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. How can I apply what I learned in real-life situations?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I can apply what I learned by being more observant and analytical in solving 
            everyday problems. Whether it’s understanding how technology works, 
            conserving energy, or practicing proper waste management, 
            I can use science-based knowledge to make smart and responsible decisions as a student.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Did I actively participate in the event? How?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Yes, I actively participated in the Science Month celebration by joining 
            in the efforts of the WINS Corner competition
           and cheered on representatives of our section in the activities
            conducted by our school’s science club.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. If I were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I would explain that Science Month is a celebration that highlights the 
            importance of scientific learning and innovation. 
            It encourages students to explore, experiment, and appreciate how 
            science contributes to progress in technology, health, and the environment.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer.</strong></p>
        <p>
            It’s important to have subject-based events like Science Month because they make 
            learning fun and interactive. These activities motivate students to apply 
            classroom lessons in creative and practical ways while promoting teamwork, 
            innovation, and curiosity.
