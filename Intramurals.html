        <h2>Reflection Questions and Answers</h2>

        <p><strong>1. What is the most important thing I learned from the event?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The most important thing I learned from the Intramurals event is the value of 
            <span class="highlight">sportsmanship, teamwork, and discipline</span>. 
            Winning or losing wasn’t the most important part — what mattered was how we supported 
            and respected one another throughout the games.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. How can I apply what I learned in real-life situations?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I can apply what I learned by practicing good sportsmanship every day — not only in sports, 
            but also in school and at home. I learned that teamwork and cooperation are key to success 
            in any activity, whether it’s a group project or a friendly competition.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Did I actively participate in the event? How?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Yes, I actively participated by cheering for my team and joining tug o' war. Even though not everyone could play in every match, 
            we all played a role in supporting our group and contributing to our team’s spirit.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. If I were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I would explain that Intramurals is an event that brings the whole school together 
            through friendly sports competitions. It’s not just about physical ability but also about 
            <span class="highlight">unity, discipline, and respect</span>. 
            It teaches us to handle both victory and defeat with grace.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer.</strong></p>
        <p>
            It’s important to have events like Intramurals because they allow students to relax, 
            interact, and show their talents outside the classroom. These events help promote 
            camaraderie, healthy competition, and school pride — all of which help build a 
            balanced and supportive learning environment.
        </p>

            <h3>Event Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                The Intramurals were filled with excitement and energy as different teams 
                competed in various sports like basketball, volleyball, athletics, and laro ng lahi.
                The event started with an opening parade, followed by team chants and 
                friendly games. Everyone displayed teamwork and enthusiasm, making the event 
                both fun and memorable.
