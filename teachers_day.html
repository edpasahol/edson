        <h2>Reflection Questions and Answers</h2>

        <p><strong>1. What is the most important thing I learned from the event?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The most important thing I learned from Teacher’s Day is the value of 
            <span class="highlight">respect, appreciation, and gratitude</span> 
            for our teachers. They dedicate their time, knowledge, and patience to help us 
            grow not only academically but also as good and responsible individuals.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. How can I apply what I learned in real-life situations?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I can apply what I learned by showing respect and kindness to my teachers every day.  
            I will continue to study hard as a way of honoring their effort, and I will also 
            extend gratitude to other people who guide and teach me in life, such as my parents 
            and mentors.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Did I actively participate in the event? How?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Yes, I participated by helping with the class presentation prepared for our teachers.  
            I also joined in giving gifts and greeting teachers.  
            It felt rewarding to see the smiles on our teachers’ faces as we expressed our appreciation.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. If I were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I would explain that Teacher’s Day is a special occasion to honor the hard work 
            and dedication of educators.  
            It reminds us that teachers play an important role in shaping our future, 
            and that even simple acts of appreciation can mean a lot to them.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Why is it important to have an event (per subject)? Explain your answer.</strong></p>
        <p>
            It’s important to have events like Teacher’s Day because they strengthen the bond 
            between students and teachers.  
            These celebrations remind us of the importance of gratitude, 
            respect, and positive relationships within the school community.
